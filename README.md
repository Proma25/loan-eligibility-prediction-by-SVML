**INTRODUCTION:**  A loan is a sum of money that one or more individuals or companies borrow from banks or other financial institutions so as to financially manage planned or unplanned events, and the core business of banks. But when it comes to deciding whether the applicant’s profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not, banks have to look after many aspects. Using Machine Learning algorithm, using Python, it would be predicted whether a candidate’s profile is relevant or not using certain features.  As main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. repayment of loans becomes crucial.


**PROPOSED METHODOLOGY**:
Data lays the foundation of the project. 
The dataset contains 13 attributes, and Loan_ Status is the target variable,
1	Loan	A unique id 
2	Gender	Gender of the applicant Male/female
3	Marital status	Marital Status of the applicant, values will be Yes/ No
4	Dependence	It tells whether the applicant has any dependents or not.
5	Education	It will tell us whether the applicant is Graduated or not.
6	Self_Employed	This defines that the applicant is self-employed i.e. Yes/ No
7	ApplicantIncome	Applicant income
8	CoapplicantIncome	Co-applicant income
9	LoanAmount	Loan amount (in thousands)
10	Loan_Amount_Term	Terms of loan (in months)
11	Credit_History	Credit history of individual’s repayment of their debts
12	Property_ Area	Area of property i.e. Rural/Urban/Semi-urban 
13	Loan_status	Status of Loan Approved or not i.e. Y- Yes, N-No 

 **** ALGORITHMS USED:******
	Machine is trained using labelled data
	The algorithm learns from labelled training data and predicts outcomes for unseen data
